# CS372 - Advanced Programming and Algorithms no.5
Class Project: Another project done while I was in school.
Included are the following files:
- CS372-assn5-Mello-95: The grading rubric and my final grade (This was my actual grade with feedback from Prof. in blue.).
- Mello-assn5-analysis: An analysis we were required to turn in with the assignment.
- Mello-ass5-prog.cpp: The actual program.
- Mello-ass5-testdata A & B: Test data to use with code.

This assignment required us to do the following: 

Write a program to implement storing a list of integers into a binary search tree.
The program will:
- Read integer data from a text file and store unique integers into a binary tree.
- After all data has been read, within a loop, let the user choose to:
- Display all the integers in the binary tree
- Add a value to the tree
- Delete a value from the tree
- Find an value within the binary tree, and display its subtree
- Exit the program
